# Concurrency in Java

This program is developed to understand the use of concurrency within the Java platform. 

This example of the program uses the classic Rock, Paper and Scissors game to utilise concurrency by allocating different number of players, which in turn will compete with one another.

The end result will show all the players finishing their turns and show which player won, drew and lost. 

## To run the program

Get the copy of the program through this github page and make sure you have an appropriate development editor and Java SDK/JDK installed. 

This program was done using Eclipse Editor.
